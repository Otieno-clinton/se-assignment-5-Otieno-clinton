        Advantages Over External Terminal:
            Convenience: Accessible directly within the editor; no need to switch windows.
            Context-Aware: Automatically opens with the path set to your current project directory.
            Integrated Workflow: Run build tasks, version control commands, and more alongside your code.
        
7. File and Folder Management:
   - Explain how to create, open, and manage files and folders in VS Code. How can users navigate between different files and directories efficiently?

    Creating Files/Folders:
        In the Explorer view, right-click and select “New File” or “New Folder”.
        Use the shortcuts Ctrl+N for a new file and Ctrl+Shift+N for a new window.
    
    Opening Files:
        Click on a file in the Explorer to open it in the Editor Group.
        Use Ctrl+P to quickly search and open files by name.
    Managing Folders:
        Add folders to your workspace by dragging them into the Explorer or using “Add Folder to Workspace”.
        Right-click on files or folders for options like rename, delete, or move.
    
    Navigating Between Files/Directories:
        Use tabs to switch between open files.
        Use Ctrl+Tab to navigate through open files in order.
        Use the breadcrumbs at the top of the editor to navigate up the directory structure.
    
8. Settings and Preferences:

        Search for the command you want to change and set a new keybinding.

9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
   
           Set Up:
            Open the program you want to debug.
            Go to the Run view by clicking the Run icon in the Activity Bar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+D.

        Configure:
            Click on “create a launch.json file” to set up your debugging environment.
            Select the environment for your program (e.g., Node.js, Python).

        Breakpoints:
        Set breakpoints by clicking on the left margin next to the line numbers where you want the debugger to pause.    

        Start Debugging:
            Press F5 or click the green play button to start debugging.
            The debugger will stop at breakpoints, and you can inspect variables, step through code, and evaluate expressions.

        Key Debugging Features:
            Call Stack: Shows the stack trace of active functions.
            Variables: Inspect local and global variables.
            Watch: Evaluate expressions that change over time.

    Initialize Repository:
            Open the folder where your project is located in VS Code.
            Open the Source Control view by clicking the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+G.
            Click “Initialize Repository” to create a new Git repository.

    Making Commits:
         Make changes to your files.
         In the Source Control view, stage your changes by clicking the “+” icon next to each file or “Stage All Changes”.
         Enter a commit message and press Ctrl+Enter to commit the staged changes.

    Pushing Changes to GitHub:
         Connect your local repository to a GitHub repository by setting the remote URL (git remote add origin [URL]).
         Use the “…” menu in the Source Control view to push changes by selecting “Push” or use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+P and type “Git: Push”.
